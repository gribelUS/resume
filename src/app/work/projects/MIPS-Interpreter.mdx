## Overview

This project was designed for academic purposes in a Computer Engineering class. It interprets MIPS assembly code, visualizing the live execution process, and showcasing register and memory updates in real time.

## Key Features

- **MIPS Assembly Simulation**: Executes a subset of MIPS instructions and updates register/memory states accordingly.
- **Step-by-Step Execution**: Allows users to input an instruction in machine code or MIPS assembly and recieves the conversion to the respective option.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Handles MIPS parsing, and UI state updates.
- **C**: Handles logic to recreate the MIPS assembly instructions

## Challenges and Learnings

Understanding and accurately simulating MIPS instructions behavior required a deep understanding of assembly operations, CPU architecture, and data handling.

Key learnings include building interpreters, visualizing low-level processes, and maintaining well structured documentation.

## Outcome

The project successfully delivers a system that can translate 32-bit machine code to MIPS assembly instructions and vice-versa.
