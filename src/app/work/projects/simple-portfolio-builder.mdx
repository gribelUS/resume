## Overview

This project was designed for academic purposes in a Database Design and Theory class, and accomplished with a team of two developers including myself, and one person handling documentation.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication System**: Enables users to register, log in, and manage sessions securely using Django's built-in authentication framework.
- **Product Listing and Search**: Displays available products in a structured catalog with search and filtering capabilities for easy navegation.
- **Shopping Cart Functionality**: Allows users to add, update, or remove items from their cart, with cart data maintained across sessions and warning for socket incompatibility between motherboard and processor.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Powers the backend logic, data processing, and custom scripts for database operations.
- **MySQL**: Used as the relational database to store user data, product listings, and transactions.
- **Django**: Serves as the core web framework, handling user authentication, routing, and business logic.
- **Bootstrap**: Provides responsive design and prebuilt UI components for a consistent layout.
- **HTML/CSS**: Structures and styles the frontend interface of the marketplace.
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity to dynamic page elements like modals and form handling.
- **Git/GitHub**: Used for version control and team collaboration.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges in building the Red Tiger marketplace was implementing a robust and consistent process to handle transactions, inventory update, and connecting the correct data between users (buyer and seller).
Another significant learning was ensuring data and coding structure consistency for eficient development and version control.

## Outcome

The project successfully delivers a functioning e-commerce platform where users can create accounts, browse and filter products, and add items to their carts. Key technical outcomes include a responsive frontend using Bootstrap, a well-structured backend in Django, and optimized database operations via raw SQL.
